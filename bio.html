    <p>My name is Matt Daly. I'm currently a junior at Tufts University
    studying computer science, with a minor in economics. I am especially
    interested in computer security applications and am excited to learn more
    and potentially pursue a career. Outside of academic pursuits, I have
    always had a strong passion for athletics. I currently enjoy both skiing
    and playing golf in northern New England.</p>
